Thank you for taking the time to learn about this research study! I truly appreciate your interest and would like to take a few minutes to explain the purpose of the study, what your participation would involve, and how your contribution could make a meaningful difference.

The goal of this study is to better understand how long-term and daily dietary practices influence the oral microbiome – the diverse community of microorganisms that live in your mouth. The oral microbiome plays a critical role not only in maintaining oral health but also in influencing overall health. By exploring the connection between diet and these microbial communities, we hope to identify potential dietary interventions that could improve both oral and whole-body health. Your participation may help us gain valuable insights that could benefit our community and beyond.

This study is important because the oral microbiome is often overlooked in discussions about health, yet it is a key player in preventing diseases like cavities, gum disease, and even conditions such as cardiovascular disease. By understanding how diet shapes these microbial communities, we may be able to develop practical recommendations to promote better health outcomes for individuals in the future. 

If you decide to participate, here is what you can expect:

1.	Online survey: You will first be asked to complete an online survey about your dietary habits, oral hygiene practices, and general demographics (such as age and gender). This survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.
2.	Follow-up visit (if eligible): If you qualify for the next phase of the study, you will be invited to a follow-up meeting. During this visit, you will:

-	Provide a non-invasive oral swab sample
-	Complete a 24-hour dietary recall survey to provide more detailed information about your recent food intake

This visit will take place in my lab on campus (George C. Frison Building, Room #349) and will last about 30 to 45 minutes. I will work with you to schedule a time that fits your availability. 

I want to assure you that your privacy is of the upmost importance. All information you provide will be kept strictly confidential. Your data will be anonymized, meaning your name and any identifying information will not be linked to your responses or samples in any published or shared results. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without any penalty. 

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly at amann11@uwyo.edu. I’d be happy to provide more details or address any concerns you might have. 

Thank you again for considering being part of this research.
